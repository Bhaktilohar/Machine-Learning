Iris Flower Classification

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning for classifying Iris flowers into three species based on their sepal and petal measurements using the Random Forest algorithm. It utilizes the Iris dataset from Scikit-learn and provides a simple yet effective approach to understand how classification models work.
